# SourceCred Python

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/sourcecred.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/sourcecred/)
[![GitHub actions status](https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred-python/workflows/ci/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred-python/actions?query=branch%3Amaster+workflow%3Aci)

This will be a Python implementation of the [sourcecred](https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred)
algorithm, intended to better inspire and include data scientists and those
familiar with the Python programming language.

**under development**

## Development

My development strategy is to mirror [sourcecred](https://github.com/sourcecred/sourcecred) to
the largest extent possible. As a developer, if there is a change in (what I consider the
upstream language) I would want it to be seamless to identify the "same" file here
and make the change.

### Testing

To start, we will just have linting. Testing will be the largest driver of 
"does this work as we expect" so akin to the overall development strategy,
I want to try and use the "same" tests to validate we are okay.


### Pull Requests

I'll put some skeleton files here, and largely work on the @vsoch branch.
This way, I can open a pull request proper to get feedback (and trigger tests, etc.)
